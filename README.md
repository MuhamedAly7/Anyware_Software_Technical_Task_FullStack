# Anyware-Software-Fullstack-Task

This Task implement Full stack app using Node.js With Express.js framework as a backeand service, and React.js.

- We Have implemented Web services (endpoints) that retrive data like announcement&dues in small school management sytem.

- We have Three Schemas
    - Auth => To store users like (student, instructor, admin)
    - Announcement => Retrieve Data that concerned for every instructor's created the announcement, and can control it but no one else can.
    - Due => Retrive Data for instructors only like assignments and quizes and most of logics same as Announcement.

Auth is the key part of the application that redirect us to our dashboard and can make out operations.

- We used Redux with react it is very powerful too for managing global state and avoid lift state up and props drilling.
